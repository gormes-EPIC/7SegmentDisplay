# Lab 10: 7-Segment Displays

## Part I - Clean Up

- Write a python script called `cleanup.py` to turn off all GPIO pins on your Pi. This script will need to set all pins as output first, then set the output to Low.
- Use a light bulb to test your code. 

- [ ] Upload your code to this repository

## Part II - 7 Segment Display

1. Get a 7-segment display from the class supplies
2. Install the necessary library with `pip3 install raspberrypi-tm1637`. If pip isn't installed, use `sudo apt install pip`. 
3. Use this [site](https://thingsdaq.org/2022/10/02/7-segment-led-display-with-raspberry-pi/) as a reference to wire your display and for the code.
4. Write a python program `hello_user.py` that takes a name input from the terminal and displays "Hello Name" on the display.
5. Add comments to your Python script to explain how it works.
6. Take a short video of your stoplight working and a clear top-down photo of your wiring

- [ ] Upload `hello_user.py`, the video, and the photo to this repository. Then, continue to Part III.
 

## Part III - Stop Watch

1. Gather a light bulb, a button, and a 7 segment display.
2. Create a new python program called `stopwatch.py` which starts and stops a timer using a button input. When the stopwatch is running, the light should turn on to indicate it has been started. When the button is pressed again to end the stopwatch, the light should turn off and recorded time should be displayed on the 7 segment display.
4. Add comments to your Python script to explain how it works.
5. Take a short video of your stoplight working and a clear top-down photo of your wiring

- [ ] Upload `stopwatch.py`, the video, and the photo to this repository.
